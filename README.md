# Robotic Arm Control System

> [!NOTE]
> This project is part of the "Embedded Systems" university course.

## Project Overview

This project implements a robotic arm control system with three main components:

1. **Web Interface**: A browser-based UI that displays the camera feed and provides controls for the robotic arm
2. **Game Controller Interface**: Allows manipulation of the robotic arm via a game controller
3. **Motor Control System**: The embedded system responsible for translating commands into motor movements

All components communicate with each other via MQTT, enabling modular development and operation.
